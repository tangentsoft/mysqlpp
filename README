This is C++ API  library for MySQL.

Starting based of 1.2, this is now maintained by sinisa@cytanet.com.cy
as kevinatk@home.com doesn't have time to support this library anymore. He has
give TCX the full right to use this library as we wish. We will continue to
keep this library under LGPL.

--------
Original information from kevinatk@home.com:

After several people commented on how my quickie wrapper would be of
little use I decided to go all out and create a full featured
version.

To my knolage this library requiures gcc 2.8 or egcc or better and of
course the mysql library.

To compile the library and modify the file Configure apropretly
and type make.

I am working on trying to get this to compile into a library.
However I really don't know what I am doing. If you have some
experense with this please take a look at my makefile and uncomment the
appropriate lines and let me know if I am doing everything right.

For more information please see the manual.

I developed it using egcc ver 1.02 (I think) from the Debian hamm
package with kernel 2.0.33 and a Cryix P150+ cpu.  I am also using
Mysql 3.21.25 that is in the non-free section of the Debian
distribution.

Be sure to let me know what you think.  I depend on your feedback.

Thanks,
I can be reached at kevinatk@home.com
