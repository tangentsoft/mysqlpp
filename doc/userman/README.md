# Overview

The user manual is written in XML DocBook format, version 4.4.  It uses
the official DocBook XSL stylesheets, and will build with versions at
least as far back as 1.69.1.  (Why these versions?  They're what comes
with CentOS 5, the oldest system I still build this manual on.)

To make the HTML version of the user manual, just type `make` or `make
html` in this directory.  To make the PDF version of the manual, say
`make pdf`.  To make both versions, say `make all`.



The most likely cause of build failures is not having the right
processing programs installed.  The DocBook processing model looks
like this:

    DocBook --> [XSLT proc.] --+--> HTML
                     ^         |
                     |         +--> XSL-FO --> [XSL-FO proc.] --> PDF
                     |
             [XSL stylesheets]

"DocBook" above is a file in DocBook XML format.  It's `userman.dbx` in
the case of the MySQL++ User Manual.



# Interchangeable Elements

There are many alternatives for the elements in the square brackets:


## XSLT Processor

The first replaceable piece is an XSLT processor, which translates XML
into other text formats, such as HTML or other varieties of XML.  We use
[`xsltproc`][1] from the Gnome project.  There are several other widely
available XSLT processors, but because we use some nonstandard
extensions to XSLT — primarily [XIncludes][2] — not all XSLT processors
function as drop-in replacements.

We use the XSLT processor to do two transforms.  One is directly to
HTML.  The other is to XSL-FO, an XML-based page layout language. This
brings us to...

## XSL-FO Processor

The second replaceable piece in the diagram above is an XSL-FO
processor, which converts XSL-FO to a more directly useful page
layout format, like PDF.  The user manual's build system supports
several alternatives.

The build system relies on a simple script in this directory — `fo2pdf`
— to find an XSL-FO formatter and run it.  It looks first for [RenderX
XEP][3], which comes in a free-as-in-kitten version for personal use.
If you're in a commercial environment, RenderX wants you to use their
commercial trial version which will format this manual without
complaint, but it puts watermarks and blank pages into the output.  As
of May 2019, they want $400 for the single-user to get clean output.
It's the same as the free personal version, just with a different
license.  You don't need the higher-end versions of XEP; they don't do
anything we need here.

If `fo2pdf` can't find XEP, it then looks for [Antenna House XSL
Formatter][4].  It's pretty much the same deal as XEP: crippled demo
version for testing, and a single-user “Lite” version for $400.  There
is no free version for personal use, however.

Failing all that, `fo2pdf` falls back to the only free-as-in-liberty
XSL-FO formmatter, [Apache FOP][5].  FOP
may be available through your OS's package system.  For instance, with
Debian tyep OSes, you can just say

    $ sudo apt install fop

If FOP is not in your OS's package system, you can download
pre-built binaries from the FOP web site that will run with the
version of Java that almost certainly is available with your OS's
package system.

You might be wondering why `fo2pdf` looks for FOP last, given that
MySQL++ is itself free software and relies on a lot of other free
software.  It's just that it's a good bet that if there's a commercial
processor on the system, it was put there quite purposefully by someone
who went out of their way to make it available on that system, and so
wants it to be used.  The commercial vendors can still get money for
their products because FOP hasn't caught up with them in several
important areas.  That said, don't feel that you need to go and buy an
XSL-FO processor just to build the manuals.  We try to always keep the
manual in a state where FOP can generate adequate output.

## DocBook XSL Stylesheets

The third replaceable piece above is the DocBook XSL stylesheet set.
The stylesheets are the XSLT processor's rules, controlling how the
input XML gets transformed to the output format.  The standard DocBook
stylesheet set includes stylesheets for HTML and XSL-FO output.  The
default behavior of `xsltproc` is look for these first on your local
system, and then if it fails to find them, tries to download them on the
fly from the Internet.  Because this slows processing quite a bit even
if you have a fast Internet connection, we've disabled this feature of
`xsltproc`, so you must have the DocBook XSL stylesheets locally
installed to build the user manual.

Most Unixy type systems have pre-built DocBook XSL stylesheet packages
available:

*   **Red Hat/Fedora:** `docbook-style-xsl` RPM package, base OS repository
*   **macOS:**          `docbook-xsl` [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package 
*   **Cygwin:**         `docbook-xml??` package (?? = DocBook version)
*   **Ubuntu/Debian:**  `docbook-xsl` package, standard APT repository

Please send the name of the package for your system to [the forum][for]
if it isn't listed above, and I'll add it to the list.

If you can't find a package for your system, you can get the DocBook
stylesheets from [the source](http://docbook.sourceforge.net/).  They're
a bit tricky to set up correctly, so it's better to use a pre-built
package if you can.

If you are still having problems, post the details about it to [the
MySQL++ forum][for], and I'll try to help you debug the problem.
You might also find the FOP and/or DocBook mailing lists helpful.

# Hacking on the Manual

If you're looking to hack on the manual, here are some helpful
resources for getting up to speed on DocBook:

*   Mills' [_Installing And Using An XML/SGML DocBook Editing
    Suite_](http://tinyurl.com/8alb2) article is the best tutorial I've
    found.

*   Walsh and Muellner's [_DocBook: The Definitive Guide_
    book](https://tdg.docbook.org/) is the official DocBook referece.
    It is available both online and in dead-tree versions.
