What It Is
~~~~~~~~~~
	MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for MySQL's C API.  It is built
	around STL principles, to make dealing with the database
	as easy as dealing with an STL container.  MySQL++ relieves
	the programmer of dealing with cumbersome C data structures,
	generation of repetitive SQL statements, and manual creation
	of C++ data structures to mirror the database schema.


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	To build MySQL++, you must have the MySQL C API development
	files installed.

	On Unixy systems (Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, "real" Unix...),
	the MySQL development files are installed if you build MySQL
	from source.  If you installed MySQL as a binary package,
	then the development files are often packaged separately from
	the MySQL server itself.  It's common for the package to be
	called "MySQL-devel" or something like that.

	If you're building on Windows with Visual C++, you can install
	the native Win32 port of MySQL from mysql.com.  You should do
	a custom install, as the MySQL++ build system expects MySQL to
	be installed in c:\mysql, and not the directory-du-jour used
	by the changing installer versions.


Additional Files to Read
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The README.* files have information specific to each of the
	major platforms we support.

	For authorship information, see the CREDITS file.

	For license information, see the LICENSE file.

Building the Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	As of version 2.1, MySQL++ uses the Bakefile build system. This
	tool creates platform-specific project files and makefiles. We
	currently support these options:

	autoconf:
		For Unixy platforms, including Linux, Mac OS X, and
		Cygwin. See README.unix for details. Supplementary
		details for Cygwin are in README.cygwin.

	Visual C++:
		We ship Visual C++ 6 project files, but MySQL++ only
		works with Visual C++ 7.1 (a.k.a. Visual Studio 2003)
		or newer. Your version of Visual Studio will upgrade
		these project files for you. See README.vc for details.

	MinGW:
		We ship Makefiles made for MinGW. These currently only
		work for building static versions of the library,
		which has licensing ramifications. See README.mingw
		for details.


Example Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	You may want to try out the programs in the examples subdirectory
	to ensure that the MySQL++ API and your MySQL database are both
	working properly.  Also, these examples give many examples of the
	proper use of MySQL++.	See examples/README for further details.


Unsupported Compliers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If you're on Windows but want to use some other compiler
	besides Visual C++ or GCC, you are currently on your own.
	There have been past efforts to port MySQL++ to other Windows
	compilers, but for one reason or another, all of these ports
	have died.

	On Unixy systems, GCC still works best.  "Native" compilers
	and third-party compilers may work, but you're on your own
	to get it working.

	We have nothing in particular against these unsupported
	systems.  We just lack the time and resources to support
	everything ourselves.  If you are sufficiently motivated to
	get MySQL++ working on one of these alternate systems, see
	the HACKERS file first for guidance.  If you follow the advice
	in that file, your patch will be more likely to be accepted.
