Building MySQL++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    There are two major ways to build MySQL++: from the command line, or
    from within the Xcode IDE.

    MySQL++ has its roots in Unix and Linux, like MySQL itself.  As a
    result, the most well-supported way to build MySQL++ is from the
    command line, or Terminal as Apple likes to call it.  See
    README-Unix.txt for the generic instructions.  Further Mac-specific
    details are given elsewhere in this file.

    The option to build MySQL++ from within Xcode is new.  We added
    experimental support for it in 3.0.0, but it didn't actually get
    tested and debugged until 3.1.0.  It may still be buggy, and over
    time it's more likely to break again than the command line method,
    simply because it receives less testing during development.  Even
    fully functional, it is less flexible than building from the command
    line; Xcode's project system cannot match the power available within
    the autotools build system.

    If you try the Xcode method and find that it doesn't work, the
    easiest way around that roadblock is to build from the command line
    instead.  If you're the adventurous sort and want to contribute to
    the development of MySQL++, see the file HACKERS.txt for more info
    on fixing the source file used as input in the project file
    generation process.  We don't want fixed project files, we want a
    process that lets us consistently generate correct project files.


Prerequisite: Install the MySQL Development Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    MySQL++ is built on top of the MySQL C API library, so for MySQL++
    to build, it needs at least that library and its header files
    installed.  You don't need the server itself installed on your
    development machine, though it's often helpful anyway, for testing.
    There are many suitable sources:

    - The simplest option is to download the MySQL server DMG from
      mysql.com.  In addition to the C API files you absolultely must
      have, this gives you a nice Mac-like installation procedure and a
      preference pane for bringing the server up and down and setting it
      to start on system boot.

    - If you really only want the C API development files, MySQL offers
      them separately as Connector/C.  As of this writing, you get the
      files as a tarball, and you have to copy its contents to some
      suitable location on your hard drive.  If you're using Xcode to
      build MySQL++, you'll want to put them under /usr/local/mysql.
      MySQL++'s command line build system is far more tolerant, looking
      there and in many other typical locations.

    - If you use Fink, you can install the C API files with:

      $ fink install mysql15-dev
      
      If you also want a local MySQL server, say this instead:

      $ fink install mysql mysql15-dev
    
    - From MacPorts, http://macports.org.  I have zero information on
      this other than that it's theoretically possible for it to work.
      If you figure out how to make it work, please post the method
      to the mailing list so I can update this document.


Dealing with the 64-Bit Transition in Snow Leopard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Xcode for Snow Leopard installs two independent versions of the GNU
    Compiler Collection.  The default is GCC 4.2, and it is set up to
    build 64-bit executables by default, even if your system is booted
    into 32-bit mode.  You also get GCC 4.0, which builds 32-bit
    executables by default.  On top of that, you have the confusion
    added by Apple's decision to make all 64-bit capable machines boot
    into 32-bit mode by default, except for the Xserves.

    The first symptom most people run into as a result of this mess is
    that the "configure" script fails, yelling something about being
    unable to link to libmysqlclient, the MySQL C API client library.
    It's because the library was probably built as a 32-bit executable
    and you're using the default compiler which tries to build a 64-bit
    test executable against this library and fails.

    There are many ways out of this tarpit.  Here are the ones I prefer:

    First, you can force GCC 4.2 to build 32-bit binaries:

        ./configure CFLAGS=-m32 CXXFLAGS=-m32 LDFLAGS=-m32 --other-flags-here

    Second, you can make the MySQL++ build system use GCC 4.0 instead:

        ./configure CC=gcc-4.0 CXX=g++-4.0 --other-flags-here

    Last, you could just take Apple's implied advice and start booting
    your Mac into 64-bit mode, if it will support it.  Here's an article
    that goes into all the details:

        http://macperformanceguide.com/SnowLeopard-64bit.html

    I'm aware of other solutions to the problem, but I expect one among
    these will work for you.


Making Universal Binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    By default, the command line build system will generate libraries
    that only work with the platform you build MySQL++ on.  It can be
    convinced to build "universal" binaries instead by configuring
    the library like so:

    $ ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking \
            CXXFLAGS='-arch ppc -arch i386'

    This builds the library for the two 32-bit OS X architectures, and
    is what most people have traditionally thought of as "universal".
    However, you may also want a 64-bit build, meaning there are four
    different architectures, and thus four -arch flags needed:

    $ ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking \
            CXXFLAGS='-arch ppc -arch ppc64 -arch i386 -arch x86_64'

    These are single commands, with the line broken to keep the line
    lengths in this document reasonable.

    The first command doubles build time relative to the default
    configuration, and the second quadruples it.  It also makes the
    resulting binaries larger, which increases the amount of time
    it takes to start a program.  Build MySQL++ like this only if
    you must.

    The --disable-dependency-tracking flag is necessary because,
    when building universal binaries, it has to rebuild each source
    module multiple times, which confuses the logic that tries to tell
    when a given module needs rebuiding based on its dependencies on
    other files.
