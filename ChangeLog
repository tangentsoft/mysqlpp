1.7.18, 2004.10.01

	o Changed all the strstream (and friends) stuff to stringstream type
	  classes.  Let there be much rejoicing.

	o Query object now lets you use store() even when the SQL query
	  cannot return a result, such as a DROP TABLE command.  This is
	  useful for sending arbitrary SQL to the server.  Thanks to
	  Jose Mortensen for the patch.

	o Quote fix in configure.in, thanks to David Sward.

	o Renamed undef_short file to undef_short.hh.

	o Gentoo ebuild file is actually being shipped with the tarball,
	  instead of just sitting in my private CVS tree since 1.7.14 was
	  current.  Ooops....


1.7.17, 2004.09.16

	o Reverted one of the VC++ warning fix changes from 1.7.16 that
	  caused crashes on Linux.

	o Added a configure test that conditionally adds the extra 'level'
	  parameter to mysql_shutdown() that was added in MySQL 4.1.3 and
	  5.0.1.


1.7.16, 2004.09.13

	o Building VC++ version with DLL version of C runtime libraries, and
	  at warning level 3 with no warnings emitted.

	o VC++ build no longer attempts to fake "long long" support.  See
	  the Wishlist for further thoughts on this.


1.7.15, 2004.09.02

	o Renamed Configure file to common.am, to avoid file name conflict
	  with configure script on case-sensitive file systems.

	o Added ebuild file and ebuild target to top-level Makefile for
	  Gentoo systems.  Thanks to Chris Frey for this.

	o Small efficiency improvements to BadQuery exception handling.
	  Initial idea by Chris Frey, improvements by Warren Young.


1.7.14, 2004.08.26

	o Builds with Visual C++ 7.1.

	o Fixed a bug in custom macro generation that caused problems with
	  GCC 3.4.  (X_cus_value_list ctor definition was broken.)


1.7.13, 2004.08.23

	o Removed USL CC support.  (System V stock system compiler.)  Use
	  GCC on these platforms instead.

	o Added examples/README, explaining how to use the examples, and
	  what they all do.

	o Most of the example programs now accept command line arguments for
	  host name, user name and password, like resetdb does.

	o Renamed sinisa_ex example to dbinfo.

	o Several Standard C++ syntax fixes to quash errors emitted by
	  GCC 3.4 and Borland C++ Builder 6.  Thanks to Steffen Schumacher
	  and Totte Karlsson for their testing and help with these.

	o Added proper #includes for BCBuilder, plus project files for same.
	  Thanks to Totte Karlsson for these.


1.7.12, 2004.08.19

	o Many Standard C++ fixes, most from the GCC 3.4 patch by
	  Rune Kleveland.

	o Added Wishlist file to distribution.

	o Fixed a problem in the bootstrap script that caused complaints
	  from the autotools on some systems.

	o RPM building is working properly now.

	o Fixed the idempotency guard in datetime1.hh.


1.7.11, 2004.08.17

	o Renamed mysql++, defs and define_short files, adding .hh to the
	  end of each.  (They're header files!)  This shouldn't impact
	  library users, since these are hopefully used internal to the
	  library only.

	o Removed sqlplus.hh file.  Use mysql++.hh instead.
	
	o Added mysql++.spec, extracted from contributed 1.7.9 source RPM, 
	  and updated it significantly.  Also, added an 'rpm' target to
	  Makefile.am to automate the process of building RPMs.

	o Added bootstrap and LGPL files to distribution tarball.

	o Added pre-1.7.10 history to this file.

	o Removed .version file.  Apparently it's something required by old
	  versions of libtool.


1.7.10, 2004.08.16

	o Maintenance taken over by Warren Young (mysqlpp at etr dash usa
	  dot com.) See http://lists.mysql.com/plusplus/3326 for details.

	o Applied many of the GCC 3.x patches submitted for 1.7.9 over
	  the years.  This allows it to build on everything from 3.0 to
	  3.3.3, at least.  Because so many patches are rolled up in one
	  big jump, it's difficult to describe all the changes and where
	  they came from.  Mostly they're Standard C++ fixes, as GCC
	  has become more strict in the source code that it will accept.

	o MysqlRow used to overload operator[] for string types as well as
	  integers so you could look up a field by its name, rather than by
	  its index.  GCC 3.3 says this is illegal C++ due to ambiguities in
	  resolving which overload should be used in various situations.
	  operator[] is now overloaded only for one integer type, and a
	  new member function lookup_by_name() was added to maintain the old
	  by-field-name functionality.

	o Fixed another operator overloading problem in SQLSS macro
	  generation with GCC 3.3.

	o The _table member of SQLSS-defined structures is now const char*,
	  so you can assign to it from a const char* string.

	o Got autoconf/automake build system working with current versions
	  of those tools again.  Removed the generated autotools files from
	  CVS.

	o Renamed library file from libsqlplus to libmysqlpp.


1.7.9 (May 1 2001) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>

    * Fixed a serious bug in Connection constructor when reading MySQL
    * options
    * Improved copy constructor and some other methods in Result /
    * ResUse
    * Many other minor improvements
    * Produced a complete manual with chapter 5 included
    * Updated documentation, including a Postscript format

1.7.8 (November 14 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>

    * Introduced a new, standard way of dealing with C++ exceptions.
    * MySQL++ now supports two different methods of tracing exceptions.
    * One is by the fixed type (the old one) and one is standard C++
    * type by the usage of what() method. A choice of methods has to be
    * done in building a library. If configure script is run with
    * -enable-exception option , then new method will be used. If no
    * option is provided, or -disable-exception is used, old MySQL++
    * exceptions will be enforced. This innovation is a contribution of
    * Mr. Ben Johnson <ben@blarg.net>
    * MySQL++ now automatically reads at connection all standard MySQL
    * configuration files
    * Fixed a bug in sql_query::parse to enable it to parse more then 99
    * char's
    * Added an optional client flag in connect, which will enable usage
    * of this option, e.g. for getting matched and not just affected
    * rows. This change does not require any changes in existing
    * programs
    * Fixed some smaller bugs
    * Added better handling of NULL's. Programmers will get a NULL
    * string in result set and should use is_null() method in ColData to
    * check if value is NULL
    * Further improved configuration
    * Updated documentation, including a Postscript format

1.7.6 (September 22 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>

    * This release contains some C++ coherency improvements and scripts
    * enhacements
    * result_id() is made available to programmers to fetch
    * LAST_INSERT_ID() value
    * Connection constroctur ambiguity resolved, thanks to marc@mit.edu
    * Improved cnnfigure for better finding out MySQL libraries and
    * includes
    * Updated documentation, including a Postscript format

1.7.5 (July 30 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>

    * This release has mainl bug fixes  and code improvements
    * A bug in FieldNames::init has been fixed, enabling a bug free
    * usage of this class with in what ever a mixture of cases that is
    * required
    * Changed behaviour of ResUse, Result and Row classes, so that they
    * could be re-used as much as necessary, without any memory leaks,
    * nor with any re-initializations necessary
    * Fixed all potential leaks that could have been caused by usage of
    * delete instead of delete[] after memory has been allocated with
    * new[]
    * Deleted all unused classes and macros. This led to a reduction of
    * library size to one half of the original size. This has
    * furthermore brought improvements in compilation speed
    * Moved all string manipulation from system libraries to
    * libmysqlclient, thus enabling uniformity of code and usage of 64
    * bit integers on all platforms, including Windows, without
    * reverting to conditional compilation. This changes now requires
    * usage of mysql 3.23 client libraries, as mandatory
    * Changed examples to reflect above changes
    * Configuration scripts have been largely changed and further
    * changes shall appear in consecutive sub-releases. This changes
    * have been done and shall be done by our MySQL developer Thimble
    * Smith <tim@mysql.com>
    * Changed README, TODO and text version of manual. Other versions of
    * manual have not been updated
    * Fixed .version ``bug''. This is only partially fixed and version
    * remains 1.7.0 due to some problems in current versions of libtool.
    * This shall be finally fixed in a near future
    * Several smaller fixes and improvements
    * Added build.sh script to point to the correct procedure of
    * building of this library. Edit it to add configure options of your
    * choice

1.7 (May17 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>

    * This is mainly a release dealing with bug fixes, consistency
    * improvements and easier configure on some platforms
    * A bug in fetch_row() method of ResUse class has been fixed. Beside
    * changes that existed in a distributed patch, some additional error
    * checking has been introduced
    * A bug in escape manipulator has been fixed that could cause an
    * error if all characters had to be escaped
    * An inconsistency in column indexing has been fixed. Before this
    * version, column names in row indexing with strings, i.e.
    * row[<string>] , has been case sensitive, which was inconsistent
    * with MySQL server handling of column names
    * An inconsistency in conversion from strings to integers or floats
    * has been fixed. In prior version a space found in data would cause
    * a BadConversion exception. This has been fixed, but 100%
    * consistency with MySQL server has not been targeted, so that other
    * non-numeric characters in data will still cause BadConversion
    * exception or error. As this API is used in applications, users
    * should provide feedback if full compatibility with MySQL server is
    * desired, in which case BadConversion exception or error would be
    * abolished in some of future versions
    * A new method in ColData class has been introduced. is_null()
    * method returns a boolean to denote if a column in a row is NULL.
    * Finally, as of this release, testing for NULL values is possible.
    * Those are columns with empty strings for which is_null() returns
    * true.
    * Some SPARC Solaris installations had C++ exception problems with
    * g++ 2.95.2 This was a bug that was fixed in GNU gcc, as from
    * release 2.95 19990728. This version was thoroughly tested and is
    * fully functional on SPARC Solaris 2.6 with the above version of
    * gcc.
    * A 'virtual destructor ' warning for Result class has been fixed
    * Several new functions for STL strings have been added. Those
    * functions (see string_util.hh) add some of the functionality
    * missing in existing STL libraries
    * Conversion for 64 bit integers on FreeBSD systems has been added.
    * On those systems _FIX_FOR_BSD_ should be defined in CXXFLAGS prior
    * to configuring. Complete conversion to the usage of functions for
    * integer conversion found in mysqlclient library is planned for one
    * of the next releases
    * A completely new, fully dynamic, dramatic and fully mutable result
    * set has been designed and will be implemented in some of 2.x
    * releases
    * Several smaller fixes and improvements, including defaulting
    * exceptions to true, instead of false, as of this version
    * An up-to-date and complete Postscript version of documentation is
    * included in this distribution
    * Large chunks of this manual are changed, as well as README and
    * TODO files.

1.6 (Feb 3 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>

    * This is a major release as it includes new features and major
    * rewrites
    * Automatic quoting and escaping with streams. It works
    * automatically , depending on the column type. It will work with <<
    * on all ostream derived types. it is paricularly handy with query
    * objects and strstreams. Automatic quoting and escaping on cout,
    * cerr and clog stream objects is intentionally left out, as quoting
    * / escaping on those stream objects is not necessary. This feature
    * can be turned of by setting global boolean dont_quote_auto to
    * true.
    * Made some major changes in code, so that now execute method should
    * be used only with SSQL and template queries, while for all other
    * query execution of UPDATE's, INSERT's, DELETE's, new method exec()
    * should be used. It is also faster.
    * New method get_string is inroduced for easier handling / casting
    * ColData into C++ strings.
    * Major rewrite of entire code, which led to it's reduction and
    * speed improvement. This also led to removal of several source
    * files.
    * Handling of binary data is introduced. No application program
    * changes are required. One of new example programs demonstrates
    * handling of binary data
    * Three new example programs have been written and thoroughly
    * tested. Their intention is to solve some problems addressed by
    * MySQL users.
    * Thorough changes is Makefile system has been made
    * Better configuration scripts are written, thanks to D.Hawkins
    * <dhawkins@cdrgts.com>
    * Added several bug fixes
    * Changed Manual and Changelog

    * UnixWare 7.0 compiler

.64.1.1a (Sep 27 1998)

    * Fixed several bugs that caused my library to fail to compile with
    * egcs 1.1. Hopefully it will still compile with egcs 1.0 however I
    * have not been able to test it with egcs 1.0.
    * Removed some problem causing debug output in sql++pretty.

.64.1a (Aug 1 1998)

    * Added an (almost) full guide to using Template Queries.
    * Fixed it so the SQLQuery will throw an exception when all the
    * template parameters are not provided.
    * Proofread and speedchecked the manual (it really needed it).

    * Reworked the Class Reference section a bit.
    * Minor document fixes
    * Added more examples for SSQLS.
    * Changed the syntax of equal_list for SSQLS from equal_list (cchar

    * there corresponding constructors.
    * Added methods for creating a mysql_type_info from a C++ type_info.

.64.a (July 24 1998)

    * Changed the names of all the classes so they no longer have to
    * have Mysql in the begging of it. However if this creates a problem
    * you can define a macro to only use the old names instead.
    * The Specialized SQL Structures (formally known as Custom Mysql
    * Structures) changed from mysql_ to sql_.
    * Added the option of using exceptions thoughout the API.
    * ColData (formally known as MysqlStrings) will now throw an
    * exception if there is a problem in the conversion.
    * Added a null adapter.
    * Added Mutable Result Sets
    * Added a very basic runtime type identification for SQL types
    * Changed the document format from POD to LYX .
    * Am now using a modified version of Perceps to extract the class
    * information directly from the code to make my life easier.
    * Added an option of defining a macro to avoid using the automatic
    * conversion with binary operators.

    * Cleaned up the example code in test.cc and included it in the
    * manual.
    * Added an interface layout plan to the manual.
    * Added a reverse iterator.
    * Fixed a bug with row.hh (It wasn't being included because of a
    * typo).

.61.0.a

    * Major interface changes. I warned you that the interface may
    * change while it is in pre-alpha state and I wasn't kidding.
    * Created a new and Separate Query Object. You can no longer execute
    * queries from the Mysql object instead you have to create a query
    * object with Mysql::query() and use it to execute queries.
    * Added the comparison operators to MysqlDate, MysqlTime and
    * MysqlDateTime. Fixed a few bugs in the MysqlDate... that effected
    * the stream output and the conversion of them to strings.
    * Reflected the MysqlDate... changes in the manual.
    * Added a new MysqlSet object and a bunch of functions for working
    * with mysql set strings.
