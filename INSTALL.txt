The installation procedure depends on the compiler you use to build
MySQL++ and the OS you build it on.  There are platform-specific
instructions for all popular platforms:

	README-Cygwin.txt     - for Cygwin
	README-Linux.txt      - for Linux
	README-macOS.txt      - for macOS
	README-MinGW.txt      - for MinGW
	README-Solaris.txt    - for Solaris
	README-Visual-C++.txt - for Visual C++

If you're on some Unix variant (Linux, OS X, *BSD, Solaris, Cygwin...)
there are additional general instructions in README-Unix.txt.

See the main README.txt file for high-level instructions that apply
to all platforms MySQL++ works on.
