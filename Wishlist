Features/Changes Requested
--------------------------

Patches for any of these thoughtfully considered!

	o is_connected() may not be returning the right value.
	  <bayufa@bdg.centrin.net.id>

	o All the redefinitions in define_short.hh are bad code style.
	  We should use the Mysql* ones only, and drop the #defines.

	o Move from strstream to stringstream.  Do any other "obsolete
	  header" fixes that remain.

	o Fix the "cascading include files from hell".

	o Look through my own code for uses of custom SQL queries, and try
	  to reduce them to API features.

	o GCC 3.4 and 3.5 have yet more pedantry in them that dislikes
	  MySQL++.  Fix!
