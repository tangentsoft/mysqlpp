/***********************************************************************
 dummy.cpp - Exists solely to fix a problem with Visual Studio: it won't
	show the C/C++ project settings unless there is a *.cpp file in the
	project.  Rather than rename all the *.cc files, I'm just adding
	this to the projects for now.
