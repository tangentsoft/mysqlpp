	* sqlplus.spec.in (Packager): Created new spec.in file to work
	with autoconf/automake and libtool for easier releases of
	RPMs. (Yes, I am a Linux bigot and I think the world should
	revolve around RPMs).
	
	* configure.in: Reworked this file to work with spec.in and
	support libtool type versioning.
