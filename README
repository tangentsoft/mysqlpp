This is the C++ API for MySQL.

Starting with 1.7.10, this is maintained by Warren Young
<mysqlpp@etr-usa.com>. It was maintained by Sinisa Milivojevic
<sinisa@mysql.com> from version 1.2 to 1.7.9, and by kevinatk@home.com
prior to that.

Since version 1.1, mysql++ has been autoconfiscated.

From within the source directory, you should just need to say:
	
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install

to build and install the program.

The configure script takes many options.  Say:

	$ ./configure --help

to get a list.  Because MySQL++ comes with a great many header files,
I highly recommend you add '--includedir=/usr/local/include/mysql++' to
the configure command, to segregate the header files in their own
directory.

If you wish to install mysql++ in a root directory other than /usr/local,
run configure with --prefix=.....

You may want to try out the programs in the examples subdirectory to
ensure that the MySQL++ API and your MySQL database are both working
properly. Start with reset_db, and work through the other examples to
test things.

If you've got a fresh CVS checkout, you will need to say:

	$ ./bootstrap

before running configure for the first time.  The bootstrap script
should only need to be run once in normal circumstances.  Occasionally
automake/autoconf gets confused and you have to run it again, but this
only affects people tweaking these configuration files. (*.am, *.in,
and everything in the config subdir, mostly.)

At the moment, this project only builds under GCC 3.0 and higher. If
enough demand is there, I can fix it to build under 2.95 and newer again.
I'd rather that people just upgraded to 3.x, though. I won't be making
any effort to support older compilers.

As for non-GCC compilers, these ports will live solely through contributed
patches. I don't have access to any non-GCC based systems, so if you
want support for those systems, you'll have to help out.
